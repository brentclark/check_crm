# check_crm

This Nagios plugin (originally written by [Sysnix](https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Clustering-and-High-2DAvailability/Check-CRM/details)) is used to monitor Pacemaker clusters.

The code provided is fairly old, so I updated it.

This plugin was updated, tested and (at the time of updating), running in production on Debian 9.
