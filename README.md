# check_crm

This Nagios plugin (originally written by [Sysnix](https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Clustering-and-High-2DAvailability/Check-CRM/details) is used monitor pacemaker clusters.

The code provided is fairly old, so I updated it.

This plugin was updated and tested on Debian 9.
